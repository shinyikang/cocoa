            <h2>Chocolate Market</h2>
            <p>Chocolate is one of the most popular sweet treats in the world today, with 7.2 million metric tons of it consumed every year. The demand for the treat is also rising; its global market size increased from $178bn USD in 2019 to $208bn USD in 2020 (Statista). </p>
            <h2>Cocoa Supply Chain</h2>
            <p>Cocoa beans, the main ingredient for chocolate, are mostly harvested by smallholder cocoa farmers in West Africa. The end product, whether that be M&Ms or a dark chocolate bar, is usually manufactured in Europe or the United States. In between the cocoa farmers and the chocolate manufacturers lie multiple middlemen. <br>
            To elaborate, cocoa farmers sell cocoa beans at a low cost to local middlemen, who are the only gateway for farmers to sell cocoa. This makes the price farmers receive for cocoa extremely low and volatile. Merely 3% of the price we pay for chocolate is given to the farmers.<br>
            Once the cocoa beans are in the hands of the local middlemen, they are bought by collectors who bring them to the sea ports. From there on, large companies like ADM, Cargill, and Barry Callebaut buy, process, and export the cocoa to chocolate manufacturers across the sea. Around 24% of chocolate revenue is given to the middlemen. 
            </p>
            <h2>Problems in the Industry</h2>
            <p>The long and monopsonistic chocolate supply chain, under which cocoa farmers are at the losing end, forces most farmers to live in abject poverty. Cocoa farmers earn on average less than $1, which is below the poverty line. <br>
            Child labor is commonly witnessed in the farms, exemplifying how poor and abusive the working conditions are. These human rights violations are not being captured in the current price of chocolate. 
            Cocoa farming also has dire impacts on the environment, causing mass deforestation and wildlife endangerment. Most farmers in cocoa plantations cannot afford to sustainably maintain their trees. Pressured to constantly produce large amounts of cocoa, they end up resorting to intensive farming, planting new trees by wearing out the soil and clearing rainforests, without considering the environmental implications nor the fact that 40% of the beans are lost every year due to poor maintenance.<br>
            In 1960, much of Ivory Coast was covered by forests. Now, less than 11% of the country remains forested due to aggressive cocoa farming.
